# PennX-SD4x-Programming-for-the-Web-with-JavaScript

#### My work for edX's SD4x: Programming the Web with JavaScript, a course by PennX an online learning initiative by the University of Pennsylvania.

This course provides an introduction to modern web development using JavaScript. In addition to exploring the basics of web page creation using HTML and CSS it teaches advanced web page layout and responsive design tools such as Bootstrap. It also talks about how browsers represent a web page data using the Document Object Model (DOM) and how to develop dynamic, interactive web pages using JavaScript in the browser. Beyond fundamental JavaScript syntax and advanced language features such as callbacks, events, and asynchronous programming, you will work with jQuery, which provides functionality for simplified DOM manipulation and event handling.

This course will also introduces you to modern web frameworks and component-based libraries such as React.js for efficiently developing modular web page components, and D3.js for creating data-driven documents. It also teaches you how to represent and exchange data using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and how to access RESTful APIs on the web.

Server-side JavaScript is becoming more prevalent in the industry, with web frameworks such as Node.js and Express making it simple to create and deploy complex, data-driven web applications. This course prepares you to use such frameworks and show you how to integrate them with NoSQL databases such as MongoDB.

Thorugh the course I had to submit **6 homework Assignments** and **9 Quizzes**:

#### Homework Assignments:

1. Homework 1: HTML
2. Homework 2: JavaScript
3. Homework 3: jQuery
4. Homework 4: React
5. Homework 5: React
6. Homework 6: Node

#### Quizzes:

1. Basics of the World Wide Web
2. Developing Web Pages with HTML
3. JavaScript Basics
4. Using JavaScript in Web Pages
5. Developing Web Applications with React
6. Developing Web Applications with React
7. Creating Data-Driven Web Content with D3.js
8. Developing Web Applications with Node.js
9. Databases and Web Applications

#### Homework 1: HTML

In this assignment, I was supposed to  modify an existing HTML page that uses inline style attributes so that it instead uses an external CSS file.

In completing this assignment, I was able to:
1. Gain experience reading, understanding, and working with existing HTML
2. Apply what you have learned about CSS classes and styling

#### Homework 2: JavaScript

In this assignment, I was supposed to implement some simple JavaScript functions.

In completing this assignment, I was able to:
1. Gain familiarity with JavaScript syntax and writing JavaScript functions
2. Get experience working with JavaScript arrays and objects
3. See how to execute JavaScript code using a web browser’s console

#### Homework 3: jQuery

In this assignment, you will develop a calculator app using JavaScript and jQuery. 

In completing this assignment, you will:
1. Use the jQuery library to select HTML elements and modify their contents
2. Define callback functions that are invoked as the result of user actions in the HTML page
3. Assemble a JavaScript application consisting of multiple functions

#### Homework 4: React

In this assignment, I was supposed to develop a React component that allows the reader of a web page to change the appearance of a piece of text.

When the user clicks on the text, a small form will appear that contains:
1. a checkbox that lets the user choose whether the text should be bold
2. buttons for decreasing and increasing the text’s font size, as well as a display of the current size
3. Then, when the user clicks on the text again, the form disappears. Further details of the specification are provided below.

In completing this assignment, I was able to:

Use the React framework to create a reusable, modular component
1. Define callback functions that are invoked as the result of user actions in the HTML page
2. Use those callback functions to modify the attributes of HTML elements

#### Homework 5: React

In this assignment, you will develop a simple application to track lists of items using React.

The application you will be building has many components that work together in order to organize multiple lists. Such an app could theoretically be used to create a shopping list, a set of daily tasks, or so forth.

In completing this assignment, you will:
1. Gain experience understanding and modifying an existing React app
2. Use the Node framework to create and deploy a React app with multiple components defined in separate files
3. Gain more experience in implementing callback functions in React components that affect the components’ appearance
4. Apply what you have learned in the lessons about the relationships between React components and how components interact

#### Homework 6: Node

In this assignment, you will use Node.js and Express to develop a Web API that provides services related to data stored in a MongoDB database.

This assignment continues the “pet store” theme from previous assignments. In this case, you will build a Web API that allows applications to get information about the pets at the store and the pet toys that the store sells.

In completing this assignment, you will:
1. Learn how to set up Node, Express, Mongo, and related packages
2. Apply what you have learned about developing a Node Express app and using various objects and functions
3. Implement JavaScript queries using Mongoose to retrieve data from a MongoDB database
4. Create a server-side Web application that reads data from an incoming HTTP request and sends back JSON data in an HTTP response


### I completed the course with a 100% score.
